### Project Description:
This assignment utilizes JavaScript to build a monthly expense calculator. The calculator takes a user's monetary input (in this case, dollars used for monthly expenses for certain categories listed) and converts those totals to percentages. Once calculated, the user can see what proportion of his or her money is going to each category of expenses.

### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. JavaScript is a client-side scripting language (a lightweight programming language) that is embedded in the HTML of a web page. JavaScript produces a dynamic outuput of its program, meaning that instead of having a static html page with style elements dictated by css, the page can be interactive. JavaScript is executed in the web brower and is processed line by line as it is loaded in the browser. To cut down on load times, JavaScript is usally added towards the end of an HTML document so that longer load times don't affect the user.
2. JavaScript requires certain syntax, the set of rules that determines the construction of script programs. The syntax defines two types of values: fixed values (literals) and variable values (variables). Literals are either numbers, written with or without decimals, or they are strings, enclosed with single or double quotes. Variables store data values. JavaScript uses "var" to declare variables while "=" assigns value to the variable.   
3. There are foour ways that JavaScript can display data: 1) InnerHTML - writes data into an HTML element, 2) document.write() - writes data into the HTML output, 3) window.alert() - writes data into an alert box, and 4) console.log() - writes data into the browser console. The document.write() feature should only be used for testing since it deletes all existing HTML once the HTML document is loaded. The console.log() feature is used for debugging purposes.
